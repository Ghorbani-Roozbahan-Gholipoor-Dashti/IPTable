Maintainers

This file lists how this cookbook project is maintained. When making changes to the system, this file tells you who needs to review your patch - you need a simple majority of maintainers for the relevant subsystems to provide a :+1: on your pull request. Additionally, you need to not receive a veto from a Lieutenant or the Project Lead.

Check out How Cookbooks are Maintained for details on the process and how to become a maintainer or the project lead.
